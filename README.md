# very-Hard-Test

## Description
Challenge week 4. I really had no idea what I was doing so I used this guide: https://www.codehim.com/vanilla-javascript/javascript-multiple-choice-questions-code/

Then I just messed with the timer until I fashioned some sort of spaghetti code and it worked, same with the try again button

I couldn't figure out how to add scores and add your intials

Sorry for letting you down again
